<p>This is not an official church, at least not yet.
	<a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-religious-organizations/churches-defined">
		&quot;Churches&quot; Defined | Internal Revenue Service</a>
	lists various attributes of a church developed by the IRS. There is
	much to be done and this is a beginning. I am not sure what I will
	do here. I will start by suggesting some possibilities. I do not
	claim to be an expert on anything, I just want to get something
	started and I hope others will help.</p>
	<p>Traditional churches place strong emphasis on worshiping God. I assume
	it is very important to God that we help each other. The emphasis of this
	church is on each other. This church is intended to be more of an
	enhancement of other religions than to exclude and/or
	&quot;compete with&quot; other religions. In other words, members are free
	to be believers in other religions.</p>
<p>One problem is society is that it is easy and extremely tempting to be
    critical. What the world needs is solutions, not criticisms. It is easy to
    complain and criticize but not so easy to provide practical solutions to
    problems. One thing in particular that would be easy to do is to criticize
    religions. I want to avoid doing that and instead simply provide good
    solutions to problems.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on providing guidance in the area of
    interpersonal communication and other things that people would call
    <i>psychological</i>. One way of describing the Church of People
	is to say it is for amateur psychologists. The emphasis is on caring about
	others <strong>at the emotional level</strong>. Hopefully this can be a
    way for people to gather over the internet with an emphasis on helping
	people emotionally in ways that are rare in the world.</p>
<p>Very many people don't know how to solve problems, at least not emotional
    problems. They don't know how to discuss problems and work things out. This is
    the type of thing I think should be important for a church.</p>
    <p>The types of books I consider to be good and relevant are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Games People Play by Eric Berne</li>
        <li>What Do You Say After You Say Hello by Eric Berne</li>
        <li>I'm OK--You're OK by Thomas Harris</li>
        <li>Scripts People Live by Claude M. Steiner</li>
        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181228061138/http://www.emotional-literacy.com/fuzzy.htm">
            A Warm Fuzzy Tale</a> by Claude M. Steiner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am not sure how to integrate this into here, but it has always been a
        belief of mine that good emotions are a limited resource. So I was
        excited when I first read (in &quot;Scripts People Live&quot; probably)
        about the Warm Fuzzy Tale as above, because it expresses what I have
        believed. The web site version above is the same as the printed book; I
        suggest reading it at least.</p>
    <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <p>Many people don&#39;t know how to discuss problems and resolve them.
        For those people, it seems that when I do try to discuss problems they
        think it is just another person complaining and criticizing. I want to
        create a way for people to discuss the mature way to discuss problems
        and resolve them.</p>
    <h4>Constructive and Destructive Criticism</h4>
    <p>I think we have all heard the term <em>Constructive Criticism</em>.
        What is the opposite of Constructive Criticism? What is Destructive
        Criticism? I think one important difference is that Constructive
        Criticism is intended to begin a conversation and Destructive Criticism
        is intended to end a conversation. If someone has a criticism then the
        healthy thing to do is to try to solve the problem. Criticizing it and
        then leaving is not helping.</p>
    <h4>Bickering</h4>
    <p>We see it often, at least in television. People bickering about something.
        Nearly always, the resolution is to say something like:</p>
    <p><em class="quote">Stop it; just stop your immature bickering. You are
        behaving like children.</em></p>
    <p>Is bickering immature? Is telling people that it is immature the mature
        thing to do? Is there nothing better to do than saying it is immature
        and to never do it?</p>
    <p>I think the mature thing to do is to understand what the problem is.
        Understand how it started and what started it. I think that quite often,
        one person is mature and the other is not. In those cases, just telling
        them to stop can reward the immature person. Some people just
        complain/bicker until the problem goes away and then telling both sides
        to stop just makes the problem go away so that the immature person
        knows that it is how to behave. Understanding can be difficult to do;
        it takes time and emotions, but it is the mature thing to do.</p>
    <h3>Addiction and Repression</h3>
    <p>Which comes first, addiction or repression? People become addicted to various
        things. For some things, such as alcohol and tobacco, the addiction is medical,
        at least partially. For other things, such as gambling, it is entirely
        psychological. I think that quite often, telling someone they can't have
        something just makes them want it more. An understanding and supportive person
        would not try to make someone change just by telling them they can't have it.
